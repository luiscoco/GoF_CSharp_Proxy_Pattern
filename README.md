# GoF_Csharp_Proxy_Pattern

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows one object, called the proxy, to act as an intermediary or substitute for another object, 
called the real subject. The proxy controls access to the real subject and can add additional functionality or behavior without changing the real subject's interface.

The Proxy Pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to control access to an object, especially in situations where the real subject is resource-intensive
to create or initialize, or when you need to provide additional functionality like caching, logging, security checks, etc.
